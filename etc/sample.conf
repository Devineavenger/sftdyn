# SFTdyn configuration file

# -> you can write arbitrary python code in here!
#
# In "really complicated" setups you could redirect all calls to a database,
# for example.

# Listen on "port" (all interfaces) (default)
#        or "ip4address:port"
#        or "[ip6address]:port"

# Client hostname definitions.
#
# Map `querystring` => `hostname to update`
# e.g. a request to "http://dyn.sft.rofl/example" will update "host.dyn.sft.rofl"
# You should include a 'shared secret' in the url to prevent strangers
# from updating your host's IP.
CLIENTS = {
    # insecure simple example
    "example": "host.dyn.sft.rofl",
    # more secure variant 0
    "?hostname=myclient.dyn.sft.rofl&password=123456": "myclient.dyn.sft.rofl",
    # more secure variant 1
    "host=gnampf.dyn.sft.rofl,key=4bea92410b3146d0cfe": "gnampf.dyn.sft.rofl",
    # you can come up with anything you like for the client's 'secret' url...
}

# Alternatively, you could fetch the definitions from a file that contains
# lines like this one:
#     host=gnampf.dyn.sft.rofl,key=4bea92410b3146d0cfe: gnampf.dyn.sft.rofl
# This list would then be read at sftdyn's startup.
# you can move the the file reading into the `get_host` function
# to reload the file on every request, if needed.

#    for line in hdl:

#
# the CLIENTS dict will be evaluated below in `get_host`
#

# in any of the functions below.

#
# This option may be used to specify an authentication key for nsupdate, which
# may be useful when the user running sftdyn doesn't have access to the key
# auto-generated by bind.

    `source_ip` is the IP that sftdyn saw as peer.
                if sftdyn is behind a proxy,
                it'll see the proxy IP, i.e. `localhost`
    `headers` is the http header dict.
              in there may be `X-Real-IP`, which contains the real peer IP.
    `key` is the (unsanitized) URL query string.

    You can modify the client IP address here however you like.
    The returned IP will be the `new_ip` that is passed
    into `nsupdatecommands`, after `key` was looked up by `get_host` below
    where it was associated with a hostname.

    If this function is missing from your config file,
    by default it does `return source_ip`.
